# aitm-labs
Labs for Agile IT Management
Prof. Charles T. Betz
initially developed for SEIS 660/664, University of St. Thomas
it's tightly coupled in a few places to the courseware system.

The labs proper are named "##-lab-name.adoc"

Some labs have tech notes on approach, re-use potential, etc.

There are both "tech" and "business" labs. Tech labs are, well, technical. "Business" labs require no computing, they are discussion or paper-based.
